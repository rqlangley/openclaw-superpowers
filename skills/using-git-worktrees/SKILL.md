# Using Git Worktrees

## Overview

Ensure work happens in an isolated workspace using git worktrees.

**Core principle:** Detect existing isolation first. Ensure a remote exists. Then use git worktree. Never fight the harness.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the using-git-worktrees skill to set up an isolated workspace."

## Step 0: Detect Existing Isolation

**Before creating anything, check if you are already in an isolated workspace.**

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

**Submodule guard:** `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` is also true inside git submodules. Before concluding "already in a worktree," verify you are not in a submodule:

```bash
# If this returns a path, you're in a submodule, not a worktree — treat as normal repo
git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree 2>/dev/null
```

**If `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` (and not a submodule):** You are already in a linked worktree. Skip to Step 3 (Project Setup). Do NOT create another worktree.

Report with branch state:
- On a branch: "Already in isolated workspace at `<path>` on branch `<name>`."
- Detached HEAD: "Already in isolated workspace at `<path>` (detached HEAD, externally managed). Branch creation needed at finish time."

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (or in a submodule):** You are in a normal repo checkout.

Has your human partner already indicated their worktree preference in your instructions? If not, ask for consent before creating a worktree:

> "Would you like me to set up an isolated worktree? It protects your current branch from changes."

Honor any existing declared preference without asking. If your human partner declines consent, work in place and skip to Step 0.5.

## Step 0.5: Ensure Remote Repository Exists

Check that the project has a remote configured. This check is idempotent — it runs each time this skill is invoked but only does meaningful work once (when no remote exists yet).

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```

**If a remote already exists:** Continue to Step 1.

**If no remote exists (new project):**

```bash
REPO_NAME=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
gh repo create --private "$REPO_NAME" --source=. --remote=origin
git push -u origin main
```

Report: "Created private GitHub repo `<name>` and set as origin."

**If `gh` is not available or the command fails:** Note the failure — the project has no remote backup until this is resolved. Flag it for your human partner and continue anyway.

## Step 1: Create Isolated Workspace

Use git worktree directly to create an isolated workspace.

#### Directory Selection

Follow this priority order. Explicit preference always beats observed filesystem state.

1. **Check your instructions for a declared worktree directory preference.** If one is specified, use it without asking.

2. **Check for an existing project-local worktree directory:**
   ```bash
   ls -d .worktrees 2>/dev/null     # Preferred (hidden)
   ls -d worktrees 2>/dev/null      # Alternative
   ```
   If found, use it. If both exist, `.worktrees` wins.

3. **If there is no other guidance available**, default to `.worktrees/` at the project root.

#### Safety Verification

**MUST verify directory is ignored before creating worktree:**

```bash
git check-ignore -q .worktrees 2>/dev/null || git check-ignore -q worktrees 2>/dev/null
```

**If NOT ignored:** Add to .gitignore, commit the change, then proceed.

**Why critical:** Prevents accidentally committing worktree contents to repository.

#### Create the Worktree

```bash
# Determine path based on chosen location
# path="$LOCATION/$BRANCH_NAME"

git worktree add "$path" -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
cd "$path"
```

**Sandbox fallback:** If `git worktree add` fails with a permission error (sandbox denial), tell your human partner the sandbox blocked worktree creation and you're working in the current directory instead. Then run setup and baseline tests in place.

## Step 3: Project Setup

Auto-detect and run appropriate setup:

```bash
# Node.js
if [ -f package.json ]; then npm install; fi

# Rust
if [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then cargo build; fi

# Python
if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
if [ -f pyproject.toml ]; then poetry install; fi

# Go
if [ -f go.mod ]; then go mod download; fi
```

## Step 4: Verify Clean Baseline

Run tests to ensure workspace starts clean:

```bash
# Use project-appropriate command
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:** Report failures, ask whether to proceed or investigate.

**If tests pass:** Report ready.

### Report

```
Worktree ready at <full-path>
Tests passing (<N> tests, 0 failures)
Ready to implement <feature-name>
```

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Already in linked worktree | Skip creation (Step 0) |
| In a submodule | Treat as normal repo (Step 0 guard) |
| Remote already exists | Skip Step 0.5 |
| No remote, `gh` available | Create private repo + push (Step 0.5) |
| No remote, `gh` unavailable | Flag for human partner, continue |
| `.worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| `worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| Both exist | Use `.worktrees/` |
| Neither exists | Check instruction, then default `.worktrees/` |
| Directory not ignored | Add to .gitignore + commit |
| Permission error on create | Sandbox fallback, work in place |
| Tests fail during baseline | Report failures + ask |
| No package.json/Cargo.toml | Skip dependency install |

## Common Mistakes

### Skipping detection

- **Problem:** Creating a nested worktree inside an existing one
- **Fix:** Always run Step 0 before creating anything

### Skipping ignore verification

- **Problem:** Worktree contents get tracked, pollute git status
- **Fix:** Always use `git check-ignore` before creating project-local worktree

### Assuming directory location

- **Problem:** Creates inconsistency, violates project conventions
- **Fix:** Follow priority: existing > instruction file > default

### Proceeding with failing tests

- **Problem:** Can't distinguish new bugs from pre-existing issues
- **Fix:** Report failures, get explicit permission to proceed

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Create a worktree when Step 0 detects existing isolation
- Create worktree without verifying it's ignored (project-local)
- Skip baseline test verification
- Proceed with failing tests without asking
- Skip Step 0.5 on a new project (remote backup matters)

**Always:**
- Run Step 0 detection first
- Run Step 0.5 to verify remote exists
- Follow directory priority: existing > instruction file > default
- Verify directory is ignored for project-local
- Auto-detect and run project setup
- Verify clean test baseline
